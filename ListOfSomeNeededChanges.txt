Notes:

4 types of errors that might still exist in the loop speculator:
- Non up-to-date values. This happens when the join fails, but it is not detected by the pthreads library.
- An ocasional segmentation fault, most likely happening upon reinitialization of threads.
- Dead-lock caused by incorrect use.
- Dead-lock caused by faults in our library itself.
